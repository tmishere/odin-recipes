    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> The bifana is a traditional Portuguese sandwich that comprises of a 
        bread roll filled with marinated pork cutlets. The secret is in the
        marinade and how its cooked. It is deliciously Portuguese and simple,
        made from garlic, white wine, and a few spices.
    </p>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 4 thin pork cutlets (approximately 300gr) – If you are in Portugal you can easily find specific pork cutlets for bifanas in a supermarket or your local butcher </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> For the Marinade </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 1tsp of sweet paprika </li>
        <li> 1/2 tsp red chilli flakes </li>
        <li> 3 crushed garlic cloves </li>
        <li> 2 bay leaves </li>
        <li> 200ml dry white wine </li>
        <li> salt and black pepper to taste </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> To Fry </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 tbsp lard </li>
        <li> 2 tbsp butter </li>
        <li> 1 tbsp olive oil </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> To Serve </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 4 white crusty bread rolls (if you are in Portugal ask for carcaças or papo-seco) </li>
        <li> Mustard, we prefer a strong English one </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Preparation </h2>
    <ol> 
    <li> Let’s start by tenderizing our pork cutlets. For that you can use a meat tenderizer or even a rolling pin to gently pound the pork cutlets one by one, both sides. </li>
    <li> Place the cutlets in a bowl. Season it with salt and pepper and then add the remaining marinade ingredients rubbing it into the meat. Make sure that everything is in contact with the pork. Cover the bowl with cling film and put it in the fridge for at least 4 hours or ideally overnight. </li>
    <li> Put a frying pan over medium heat and add the fat: lard, butter and olive oil. Once the mixture is hot, gently place in our pork meat, keeping the marinade aside. You may be thinking we are using too much fat but don’t worry, the idea here is to slowly ‘confit’ the pork instead of frying it like you would normally do with a steak. </li>
    <li> Once the oils start bubbling (about 5-8 minutes) flip the pork and add to the frying pan its marinade, including the garlic. </li>
    <li> Occasionally stir and flip the pork until the garlic cloves are cooked (it will become a puree when you squeeze it with a fork). Let the sauce reduce a little bit more. </li>
    <li> Meanwhile, cut open the bread and quickly toast it, we want it still soft inside. </li>
    <li> Now it’s time to put it all together. Glaze both sides of the bread with the juicy pork sauce then add a steak. Serve it with mustard, our favourite one is an English mustard. </li>      
    </ol>
